PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
You are familiar with the numerical integration for calculating using the rectangle rule.
Simpson’s Rule is a better integration algorithm than the rectangle rule because it converges
quickly.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
A procedure named ‘SHIFT’ is to be implemented using the MPI library (not using the MPI
function but writing your own). A one dimensional array is partitioned in equal size across a
set of processors. The procedure SHIFT takes a shift factor and performs a circular shift on
the array such that the elements shifted out at one end are shifted in at the other end. Two
examples of such procedure are shown below.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Measure the timing performance of MPI collection communication routines MPI_GATHER and MPI_SCATTER (thus you will write two programs) in the same manner as a collective communication routine’s time is measured
